# data-structures-bar-ilan

<p>On a quest to program every algorithm and database learnt on DSAA course. </p>
The project already includes the following:

#### <u> Databases: </u>
- Union Find
- Fibonacci Heap
- Node-connected Graph

#### <u> Algorithms: </u>
- String searching algorithm (KMP, BM)
- Kruskal's algorithm for MST finding
- Various dynamic programming applications (such as LCS, LIS, SCS...)

#### <u> Work in progress: </u>
- Djikstra's algorithm for shortest distances
- Floyd-Warshal algorithm for maximum flow
- Prim's algorithm for MST finding
- Linear programming (Simplex and Dual Simplex)
- Ukkonen's algorithm for finding suffix tress
